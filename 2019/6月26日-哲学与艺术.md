### 《THE HEART IS A LONGLY HUNTER》
    In the dusk(n.黄昏,太阳落山后) the two mutes walked slowly home together. At home Singer was always talking to Antonapoulos. *His hands shaped the words in a swift series of designs.* His face was eager and his gray-green eyes sparkled(闪耀) brightly. With his thin, strong hands he told Antonapoulos all that had happened during the day.
    Antonapoulos sat back(休息) lazily and looked at Singer. It was seldom that he ever moved his hands to speak at all and then it was to say that he wanted to eat or to sleep or to drink. These three things he always said with the same vague(adj.含糊不清的), fumbling signs. At night, if he were not *too drunk*, he would kneel(vi.跪下) down before his bed and pray awhile. Then his plump(adj.胖乎乎的) hands shaped the words 'Holy Jesus,' or 'God,' or 'Darling Mary.' These were the only words Antonapoulos ever said. Singer never knew just how much his friend understood of all the things he told him. But it did not matter.

    太阳落山后两个哑巴一块漫步回家。到家后Singer总是找Antonapoulos说话。他的手通过一系列快速的图案塑造文字。他的脸洋溢着热情，他灰绿色的眼睛闪耀生辉。通过纤瘦却强壮的手，他把白天发生的一切告诉了Antonapoulos。Antonapoulos 懒洋洋地休息着，同时看着Singer 他几乎不动手说话，他直说想吃饭，想睡觉或者是想喝酒。他总是通过同样的含糊不清和笨拙的符号来表达这三样东西。到了晚上，如果喝得不是太醉，他会跪在床前祷告一会儿。他胖乎乎的手划着'圣主耶稣，'或者'主'，或者'圣母玛丽。'这些都是Antonapoulos说过的词。Singer不知道所有他说过的这些话，他的朋友能理解多少。不过那并没有关系。
