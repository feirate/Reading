### 《THE HEART IS A LONGLY HUNTER》
    They shared the upstairs of a small house near the business section(n.区域) of the town. There were two rooms. On the oil stove(油炉) in the kitchen Antonapoulos cooked all of their meals. There were straight, plain kitchen chairs for Singer and an overstuffed(adj.充满) sofa for Antonapoulos. The bedroom was furnished mainly with a large double bed covered with an eiderdown comforter(n.鸭绒被) for the big Greek and narrow iron cot(n.行军床) for Singer.
    Dinner always took a long time, because Antonapoulos loved food and he was very slow. After they had eaten, the big Greek would lie back on his sofa and slowly lick(vt.舔) over each one of hist teeth with his tongue, either from a certain delicacy(n.精美的食物) or because he did not wish to lose the savor(n.滋味) of the meal while Singer washed the dishes.

    他们合住在小镇商业区附近的一间小房子的二楼。那有两个房间. Antonapoulos在有油炉额厨房里料理他们所有的肉。样式简单的长条椅是Singer的座位，而被填充得慢慢的沙发是Antonapoulos。卧室里的家具主要是一个大的双人床，上面盖着一床鸭绒被，这床是希腊人的，还有一个狭小的铁质行军床是Singer。
    晚餐总是持续很长时间，因为Antonapoulos喜欢食物而且他总是很慢。在他们吃完之后，大个子希腊人总会躺在他的沙发上，用舌头慢慢地舔过每一颗牙齿，或者是因为食物确实太美味了，或者是他不希望在Singer洗盘子时失去这餐的滋味。
