### 《THE HEART IS A LONGLY HUNTER》
    They shared the upstairs of a small house near the business section(n.区域) of the town. There were two rooms. On the oil stove in the kitchen Antonapoulos cooked all of their meals. There were straight, plain kitchen chairs for Singer and an overstuffed sofa for Antonapoulos. The bedroom was furnished mainly with a large double bed covered with an eiderdown comforter for the big Greek and narrow iron cot for Singer.
