### 《THE HEART IS A LONGLY HUNTER》
    In the town there were two mutes(n.哑巴), and they were always together. Early every morning they would come out from the house where they lived and walk arm in arm down the street to work. The two friends were very different. The one who always steered(vt.引导) the way was an obese(adj.肥胖的) and dreamy(adj.迷迷糊糊的) Greak(n.希腊人). In the summer he would come out wearing a yellow or green polo shirt stuffed sloppily(adv.凌乱地) into his trousers in front and hanging loose behind. When it was colder he wore over this a shapeless(adj.走形的) gray sweater.
    His face was round and oily(adj.油的), with half-closed eyelids(n.眼睑) and lips that curved in a gentle, stupid smile. The other mute was tall. His eyes had a quick, inteligent expression. He was always immaculate(adj.洁净的) and very soberly(adv.朴素地) dressed. Every morning the two friends walked silently together until they reached the main street of the twon. Then when they came to a certain(adj.某个) fruit and candy store they paused for a moment on the sidewalk(n.人行道) outside. The Greak, Spiros Antonapoulos, worked for his cousin(n.表亲), who owned this fruit store. His job was to make candies and sweets, uncrate(vt. 打开…的包装；从板条箱中取出) the firuits, and to keep the place clean. The thin mute, John Singer, nearly always put his hand on his friend`s arm and looked for a second into his face before leaving him. Then after this goodby Singer crossed the street and walked on alone to the jewelry store where he worked as a sliverware(n.镀银餐具) engraver(n.雕刻师).

    小镇上有两个哑巴，他们总在一起。每天清晨他们从住房里出来，手挽着手走过街道去工作。这两位朋友非常不同。总是在前面引路的是一个肥胖的，迷迷糊糊的希腊人。夏天的时候，他会穿着一件黄色或者绿色的POLO衫，前边凌乱的塞进裤子里，后边松垮地垂着。如果天气变冷了，他就在这身行头外面套上一件走形的灰色毛衣。
    他圆脸，有些油腻，眼皮半睁着，嘴唇弯曲着，挂着温和而愚蠢的微笑。另一个哑巴是高个子。他的眼睛总有一闪而过的聪明的表情。他总是穿得干净而朴素。每天早上两个朋友默默地走到小镇的中心大街。接着当他们走到某个水果和糖果店时，会在外面的人行道上停一会儿。希腊人,Spiros Antonapoulos,为他的表亲工作，他的表亲拥有这家水果店。他的工作是制作糖果和甜点，从箱子中取出水果，还有清洁工作。瘦子哑巴，John Singer，几乎总是把他的手放到他朋友的手臂里，在他离开前，盯着他的脸看一会儿。道别之后，Singer穿过街道，独自走向他工作珠宝店，他在那儿当一名镀银餐具雕刻师。
