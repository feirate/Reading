### 《THE HEART IS A LONGLY HUNTER》
    In the late afternoon the friends would meet again. Singer came back to the fruit store and waited until Antonapoulos was ready to go home. The Greak would be lazily(adv.懒散地) unpacking a case of peaches or melons, or perhaps looking at the *funny paper* in the kitchen behind the store where he cooked. Before their departure(n.出发) Antonapoulos always opened a *paper sack(大纸袋)* he kept hidden during the day on one of the kitchen shelves(n.架子). Inside were stored various bits of food he had collected a piece of fruit, samples of candy, or the buttend of a liverwurst(n.肝泥香肠). Usually before leaving Antonapoulos waddled gently(缓慢地蹒跚) to the glassed case in th front of the store where some meats and cheeses were kept. He glided open(滑开) the back of the case and his fat hand groped(vi.摸索) lovingly for some particular dainty(n.美味) inside which he had wanted. Sometimes his cousin who owned the place did not see him. But if he noticed he stared at his cousin with a warning in his tight, pale face(苍白的脸). Sadly Antonapoulos would shuffle the morsel((食物)少量的) from one corner of the case to the other. During these times Singer stood very straight with his hands in his pockets and looked in another direction. He did not like to watch this little scene between the two Greeks. For, excepting drinking and certain solitary secret pleasure, Antonapoulos loved to eat more than anything else in the world.

    一天傍晚，这对朋友又见面了。Singer 从回到水果店，等着Antonapoulos准备回家。希腊人也许正在懒散地打开一箱桃子或者哈密瓜，或者可能在商店后面的厨房，他烹饪的地方在看有趣的报纸。在他们出发之前，Antonapoulos总是打开一个他白天藏在某个厨房架子上的大纸袋。里面装着各式各样他收集的食物，一片水果，糖果样品，或者是肝泥香肠的平头端。通常离开之前Antonapoulos 缓慢地蹒跚着走向商店前边的用来摆放肉和奶酪的玻璃橱柜。他滑开柜子背板，用他的肥手钟爱地摸索着里面某些他想要的特别的美味。有时候他拥有这个地方的表亲并没有看见他。但是如果他注意到了，他就会盯着他的表亲，紧绷而苍白的脸上带着警告。可怜的是，Antonapoulos会把少量的食物从柜子的一角移到另一角。每当这个时候Singer站得笔直，双手放到口袋里并看向别的方向。他不希望看到两个希腊人之间的这一幕。 因为，除了喝酒和某些孤独的令人愉快的密码，Antonapoulos在这个世界上比起其他事物来最喜欢的是吃。
